=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Authentication::AuthTkt - shim for Apache::AuthTkt

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # in your MyApp.pm file
 use Catalyst qw(
     Authentication
 );

 # Configure an authentication realm in your app config:
 <authentication>
    default_realm authtkt
    auth_url http://yourdomain/login
    <realms>
        <authtkt>
            class AuthTkt
            <credential>
                class AuthTkt
            </credential>
            <store>
                class AuthTkt
                
                cookie_name auth_tkt
                
                # either the path to your Apache .conf file
                #conf path/to/httpd.conf
                
                # or set the secret string explicitly
                #secret fee fi fo fum
                
                # these next two are the Apache::AuthTkt defaults
                timeout 2h
                timeout_refresh 0.50
                
                # explicitly define a domain for the cookie
                # NOTE the leading dot means every host in the subdomain
                domain .foo.bar.com

            </store>
        </authtkt>
    </realms>
 </authentication>
                    

 # and then in your Root controller 'auto':
 sub auto : Private {
     my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
             
     # validate the ticket and update ticket and session if necessary
     return 1 if $c->authenticate;
        
     # no valid login found so redirect.
     $c->response->redirect( $c->config->{authentication_url} );
        
     # tell Catalyst to abort processing.
     return 0;
 }

 # and then elsewhere in your app
 if ($c->user_exists) {
    $c->log->debug("Logged in as user " . $c->user->id);
    #...
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements the Catalyst::Authentication API 
for Apache::AuthTkt version 0.08 and later.

B<This module does not implement any features 
for creating the AuthTkt cookie.>
Instead, this module simply checks that the 
AuthTkt cookie is present and unpacks it
in accordance with the Authentication API. 
The intention is that you create/set the AuthTkt cookie
independently of the Authentication code, 
whether in a separate application (e.g. the mod_auth_tkt
C<login.cgi> script) or via the Apache::AuthTkt module directly.

mod_auth_tkt L<http://www.openfusion.com.au/labs/mod_auth_tkt/> 
is a single-sign-on C module for Apache.
Using this module, however, you could implement all 
the features of mod_auth_tkt, in Perl, using any
web server where you can deploy Catalyst, including 
front-end-proxy/back-end-mod_perl and lighttpd situations.
