        * Renamed from Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::AuthTkt
        * updates to support Apache::AuthTkt 0.08 API changes

0.04    29 Aug 2008
        * add Static::Simple plugin to Makefile.PL reqs (not that
          it is actually used yet...)

0.05    29 Aug 2008
        * fix POD for search.cpan.org display

0.06    2 Sept 2008

        * add 'mock' feature for running in development.
        * pass all relevant config args to Apache::AuthTkt->new 

0.08    16 Dec 2008
        * fix bug in Store->expire_ticket() where cookie not found

0.09    30 April 2009
        * set REMOTE_ADDR to $c->req->address if $c->req->address != REMOTE_ADDR.
          This fixes bug when running dev server behind proxy (similar to fcgi).
        * add patch from https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=43482
          to check that authtkt cookie has a value.

0.10    7 May 2009
        * explicit $c->logout anytime AuthTkt parsing fails, since if Session plugin
          is being used, the $c->user object is cached in session.
